    <h4>Customized company chatbot with memory, chat history and safe data processing</h4>
    <p>"How can I build a ChatGPT-like application that my employees can use safely and that is tailored to the specific needs of our company?" That is a question a lot of organisations struggle to answer. In this project, I am going to tackle that problem by explaining the project architecture, the build and the deployment. In addition I will explain how to build in the necessary safety features guardrails, for example by blocking certain content and monitoring and managing application usage. </p>

    <h4>DebateTracker: a vector search AI-enhanced application for monitoring speeches in political debates </h4>
    What arguments are politicians and their parties actually using in debates? In this project, I will explain how to leverage LLM's and semantic search to get get better insight in the political speeches of parties and individual politicians. We will be building an application that will automatically pull data from      official sources and let users discover the transcripts through a semantic search engine. In addition, users can add fragments of debates around a certain topic to a collection. In summmary we will build an application that:
    <ul>
        <li> (1) Synchronizes, imports and summarizes debate transcripts from sources such as Tweedekamer.nl API </li>
        <li> (2) Let users search through this data based on relevance with the help of a semantic search engine </li>
        <li> (3) Let users add fragments to collections around a topic of their interest </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Automatic matching and writing of grant applications using web scraping, company information and interview transcripts.</h4>
    <p>Writing grant applications is time-intensive and requires knowledge of specific writing styles and argumentation. In this project, I will explain how to build an application that will match companies with potentially interesting grant opportunities, and write concept grants based on company information and interview transcripts.</p>

    <h4>Market prediction: estimating price movements in natural resources using advanced algorithms</h4>
    <p>Quantative finance revolves around letting algorithms learn the characteristics of the price movements in specific markets. In this quantative finance project, I will explain how to build an application that can predict market prices based on historical price data, and suggest trading strategies to users based on these predictions. </p>

    <h4>Predicting donor churn with XGBoost</h4>
    <p>Donors that are not actually coming to their blood donation appointments are a costly endeavour for blood banks. In this project, we will therefore explain how to train an algorithm than can predict if donors come to their appointment using the XGBoost algorithm. The algorithm will suggest whether or not a donor falls into the 'high risk' category that </p>
